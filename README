tlssh/README

What is it?
-----------
It's like SSH but based on TLS. And you only log in using client
certificates, never usernames or passwords.


Why?
----
I often find that OpenSSH is too big, has too many features that can
subvert security. Yet it doesn't have the features that I want
(expiring login keys for example).

I wanted a minimal crypto layer on top of the SSL crypto model.


Installing
----------
See INSTALL file.


Notes
