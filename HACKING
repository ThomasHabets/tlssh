Protocol
========
Normal TLS connection with both client and server cert, as well as
Diffie-Hellman. If crypto parameters are incorrect the connection is simply
closed.

Client then sends a few header commands, one on each line:
  version <n>         # Protocol version. Currently 1.
  env <name> <val>    # Set env variable <name> to <val>, currently only TERM
  terminal <on/off>   # Allocate pty for client. Default to on.
  command <cmdline>   # Command to run.
  tcpmd5 <password>   # Activate TCP MD5 after headers (not implemented)

Only "version" is mandatory.

Header part is done when client sends an empty line. Lines end with \n only.

Connection in then set up.

All data is sent as-is except byte 255 (IAC, Interpret As Command,
from Telnet protocol). IAC commands are:
    1 - Set window size. Two 16bit network-order ints follow with height,width.
    2 - Echo request. 32bit echo cookie.
    3 - Echo reply. 32bit echo cookie.
  255 - Send literal byte 255

Client sends IAC 1 (set window size) with updated size every time the
local terminal changes size (it gets SIGWINCH). The client sends its
first set-window-size as soon as the connection is set up.


Exceptions
==========
The THROW and THROW0 macros are used to throw exceptions. They
automatically include __FILE__, __LINE__ et.al. so that information
doesn't have to be typed everywhere.

All exceptions inherit from Err::ErrBase (errbase.h) which in turn
inherits from std::exception. Besides std::exception::what(),
Err::ErrBase adds what_verbose(), which includes file, line and
function where the exception was thrown.


Coverage
========
make check
(
	set -e
	cd src
	gcov -l sslsocket_test-sslsocket.cc
	./gs.py sslsocket_test-sslsocket.cc##sslsocket.cc.gcov
)
