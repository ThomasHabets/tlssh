Exceptions
==========
The THROW and THROW0 macros are used to throw exceptions. They
automatically include __FILE__, __LINE__ et.al. so that information
doesn't have to be typed everywhere.

All exceptions inherit from Err::ErrBase (errbase.h) which in turn
inherits from std::exception. Besides std::exception::what(),
Err::ErrBase adds what_verbose(), which includes file, line and
function where the exception was thrown.
