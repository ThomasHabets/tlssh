Protocol
========
Normal TLS connection with both client and server cert, as well as
Diffie-Hellman. If crypto parameters are incorrect the connection is simply
closed.

Client then sends a few header commands, one on each line:
  version <n>         # Protocol version. Currently 1
  env <name> <val>    # Set env variable <name> to <val>, currently only TERM

Header part is done when client sends an empty line. Lines end with \n only.

Connection in then set up.

All data is sent as-is except byte 255 (IAC, Interpret As Command,
from Telnet protocol). IAC commands are:
    1 - Set window size. Two 16bit network-order ints follow with height,width.
  255 - Send literal byte 255

Client sends IAC 1 (set window size) with updated size every time the
local terminal changes size (it gets SIGWINCH). The client sends its
first set-window-size as soon as the connection is set up.


Exceptions
==========
The THROW and THROW0 macros are used to throw exceptions. They
automatically include __FILE__, __LINE__ et.al. so that information
doesn't have to be typed everywhere.

All exceptions inherit from Err::ErrBase (errbase.h) which in turn
inherits from std::exception. Besides std::exception::what(),
Err::ErrBase adds what_verbose(), which includes file, line and
function where the exception was thrown.
